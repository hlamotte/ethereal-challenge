# ethereal-challenge

A few pointers:
(i) We'd like this to be a discussion between us - and getting a better sense of how you think things through
(ii) There's no need to prepare a deck for this - a couple of structured notes or dashboards would be great for this purpose
(iii) Have fun!

We're looking forward to reconnecting and having a thought-provoking discussion with you. Thanks!

## 1 - Hyperdrive analytics:
Element Finance is embarking on a new version of their fixed-rate AMM protocol, Hyperdrive. As part of the process, the team is also working on a couple of [agent-based simulations](https://github.com/element-fi/elf-simulations) in Google Colab/Jupyter notebooks. We’d like you to play around with the same and report back to us

Choose a set of market conditions, install libraries and run the experiment - and let’s discuss some of the runs

What kind of market conditions can you test this out against? Why are these interesting?

How would you improve the agent modelling framework? What kind of agents would you like to be included in the model? How would this then be run?

## 2 - Twitter API deep-dive:
We’d like to do a run-down of the same exercise we touched upon for Twitter - and getting/filtering topics of interest in the Starknet ecosystem

Choose one out of two questions (3,4) below:
## 3 - Cosmos indexing: 
Choose your favourite appchain on Cosmos ecosystem and present a small dashboard pertaining to this app

What kind of explorer/graphQL endpoint did you prefer to do this on and why?

Describe this project and justify what you feel are its most important metrics

What are the main differences between indexers on Cosmos and Eth?

Trends around user activity, actions taken over different time periods

## 4 - Bridges/Dune Analytics: 
There have been multiple instances of bridges that have been used to help move assets and state from one ecosystem to another. We’d like you to create a small dashboard highlighting some of this activity. There are a few pointers that we could suggest, but please feel free to present this information as you see fit!

What core contracts would you use to track this kind of activity?

Trends around volume/TVL, assets, bridging solutions, user activity, key contracts, highly used/in-demand contracts over a weekly period

If you were to move assets from one ecosystem to another, which kind of bridge solution would you use? There is some ambiguity in this question, but feel free to expound on your thoughts

What are the core issues you see with Dune Analytics as it relates to highlighting more information on this category?

If you were to build out a product like Dune Analytics, what kind of architecture/software components would you use?

Given a chance to re-architect Dune Analytics (as per the issues seen), how would you go about doing it?
