ZK-STARK
- scalable transparent argument of knowledge
- newer
- avoid trusted setup phase

ZK-SNARK
- succinct, non-interactive argument of knowledge
- Zcash
- Setup phase generating and distributing secret public parameters

CAIRO
- Programming language for StarkNet
- For dApps with exponential throughput and L1 security
- Projects
    - DeversiFi - SPOT trading
    - Immutable - NFT trading
    - dYdX - perpetual trading
- Proof created off-chain, then verified (exponentially quicker) on-chain.
- Key properties
    - Scalable (linear proof, exponentially small verifier time)
    - Transparent - no toxic waste - trusted setup
    - Universal - applicable to general computation
- CAIRO has one universal AIR and a compiler to that AIR.
