- V3 focuses on improving capital efficiency.
- V3 makes it easier to increase exposure on a specific asset without reducing downside risk.
- Add single assets to liquidity to a price-range that is above of below current price, fee earning limit order that executes along a smooth curve. __Concentrated liquidity__
- Limit order = buy or sell at specific price
- Multiple fee tiers
- Oracles also improved
- V2 deposited liquidity across entire price range by default

`x * y = k`

`x, y` = amount of tokens X and Y

`k` = constant during trades, recalculated when liquidity provided/withdrawn

x and y are the only variables controlled by the market. If you do a trade depositing some amount of x, you use the equation to calculate how much you get.

Impermanent loss = price changes after liquidity provider deposits token, but price can recover

Derivative of graph = price

Active liquidity
- If moves outside price range, liquidity is removed from pool, and liquidated into one asset
